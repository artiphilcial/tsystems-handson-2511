# IBM Cloud Account Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up your IBM Cloud account to access the workshop resources.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create an IBM ID

Visit the IBM registration page and create your IBM ID:

```
https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776
```

Fill out the required information and complete the registration process.

> When prompted to enter credit card details, you don't need to provide any details as you will be invited to the workshop account.

### 2. Accept the IBM Cloud Invitation

Once all accounts have been created, we will add you to the workshop account (during Monday, 24.11.2025)
You will then receive two emails from IBM Cloud:

1. Look for the email with the subject **"You've been invited to an IBM Cloud account"**
2. Click on the **"Join here"** button in the email
3. Follow the prompts to accept the invitation

### 3. Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

When logging in for the first time:

1. You will be prompted to set up 2FA
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the 2FA setup

### 4. Access Your IBM Cloud Account

Once logged in:

1. You should see your IBM Cloud account dashboard
2. Click on the **hamburger menu** (☰) in the top-left corner to navigate through the IBM Cloud services

## Troubleshooting

- **Didn't receive the invitation email?** Check your spam/junk folder
- **Having trouble with 2FA?** Contact the workshop organizer for assistance
- **Can't see the account?** Make sure you're logged in with the correct IBM ID

## Next Steps

Once your account is set up, you're ready to proceed with the workshop exercises!
